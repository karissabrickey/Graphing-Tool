# Graphing-Tool
This program requires the user to enter coordinate points of graphs,
the section of this original graph they would like re-drawn (source_rect),
and the dimensions of the rectangle they would like these points to be
drawn in on the screen (target_rect).
It then draws the new "chopped" graph to the screen inside the target
rectangle. Various visual attributes may be specified regarding the final
graph, including line widths and colors, labels, axis, and graph title.
